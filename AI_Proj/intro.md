Automatic text summarization

Automatic text summarization is the process of shortening long texts or paragraphs and generating a concise summary that passes the intended message. There are 2 main methods to summarize texts:

    Extractive summary: In this method, the output text will be a combination of meaningful sentences extracted directly from the original text.
    Abstractive summary: This method is more advanced, as the output is a new text. The aim is to understand the general meaning of sentences, interpret the context, and generate new sentences based on the overall meaning. 

In both methods, NLP is used in the text interpretation steps, which are:

    Cleaning the text from filling words
    Sampling the text into shorter sentences (tokens)
    Creating a similarity matrix that represents relations between different tokens
    Calculating sentence ranks based on semantic similarity
    Selecting sentences with top ranks in order to generate the summary (either extractive or abstractive)

9. Clinical documentation

In 2017, it was estimated that primary care physicians spend ~6 hours on EHR data entry during a typical 11.4-hour workday. NLP can be used in combination with optical character recognition (OCR) to extract healthcare data from EHRs, physicians’ notes, or medical forms, in order to be fed to data entry software (e.g. RPA bots). This significantly reduces the time spent on data entry and increases the quality of data as no human errors occur in the process.

NLP use cases in finance
15. Credit scoring

Credit scoring is a statistical analysis performed by lenders, banks, and financial institutions to determine the creditworthiness of an individual or a business. NLP can assist in credit scoring by extracting relevant data from unstructured documents such as loan documentations, income, investments, expenses, etc. and feed it to credit scoring software to determine the credit score. In addition, modern credit scoring software utilize NLP to extract information from personal profiles (e.g. social media accounts, mobile applications) and utilize machine learning algorithms to weigh these features and assess creditworthiness.
16. Insurance claims management

NLP can be used in combination with OCR to analyze insurance claims. For example, IBM Watson has been used to comb through structured and unstructured text data in order to detect the right information to process insurance claims, and feed it to an ML algorithm which labels the data according to the sections of the claim application form, and by the terminology that commonly is filled into it. 

20. Stock prices prediction

NLP is used in combination with KNN classification algorithms to assess real-time web-based financial news, in order to facilitate ‘news-based trading’, where analysts seek to isolate financial news that affects stock prices and market activity. To extract real-time web data, analysts can rely on web scraping or web crawling tools.
