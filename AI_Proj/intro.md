Automatic text summarization

Automatic text summarization is the process of shortening long texts or paragraphs and generating a concise summary that passes the intended message. There are 2 main methods to summarize texts:

    Extractive summary: In this method, the output text will be a combination of meaningful sentences extracted directly from the original text.
    Abstractive summary: This method is more advanced, as the output is a new text. The aim is to understand the general meaning of sentences, interpret the context, and generate new sentences based on the overall meaning. 

In both methods, NLP is used in the text interpretation steps, which are:

    Cleaning the text from filling words
    Sampling the text into shorter sentences (tokens)
    Creating a similarity matrix that represents relations between different tokens
    Calculating sentence ranks based on semantic similarity
    Selecting sentences with top ranks in order to generate the summary (either extractive or abstractive)

In 2017, it was estimated that primary care physicians spend ~6 hours on EHR data entry during a typical 11.4-hour workday. NLP can be used in combination with optical character recognition (OCR) to extract healthcare data from EHRs, physiciansâ€™ notes, or medical forms, in order to be fed to data entry software (e.g. RPA bots). This significantly reduces the time spent on data entry and increases the quality of data as no human errors occur in the process.
