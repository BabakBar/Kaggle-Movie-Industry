    "2- Significance and P-Value: In statistics, the p-value depicts the probability that, assuming the null hypothesis is correct, you might still observe results that are at least as extreme as the results of your hypothesis test. The smaller the p-value, the more likely the alternative hypothesis is correct, and the greater the significance of your results.\n",

    "What is the Multiple Testing Problem?\n",
    "If you run a hypothesis test, there’s a small chance (usually about 5%) that you’ll get a bogus significant result. but if 20 different researchers evaluate 20 different aspects of a policy intervention, even if the intervention did nothing, we should expect one statistically significant result and 19 statistically insignificant results. When you run multiple tests, the p-values have to be adjusted for how many hypothesis tests you are running. "
